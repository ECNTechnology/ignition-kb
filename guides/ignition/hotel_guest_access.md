Guest users, for example Hotel Room are extensions created with restricted set of features.<br>
A guest user cannot make or receive external calls directly, or be listed as a Next Activity destination or member of a call queue or ring group. <br>
Guest users can however call other users on the system as well a virtual extensions.
<br>
Each gest user will be provisioned with the same set of line keys (eg: 'Reception', 'Gym', 'Room Service', etc).
<br>
Use Cases: 
  - This type of user is perfect for use in a Hotel Room, where you want to configure a large group of users rapidly.
  - VoIP Cameras.

<br>
Due to the restrictions on available functionality, these users are charged at a lower rate to standard users.
