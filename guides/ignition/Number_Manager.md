## Vanity Numbers
**What are Vanity Numbers?**

Vanity numbers give customers the ability to use different numbers for outbound call presentation.

**Why are Vanity numbers used?**

When customers migrate from a traditional PBX to the cloud-hosted myCloudPBX platform, they often face the problem of numbers still being hosted on their traditional PBX during the migration process, or, a traditional telephone service such as ISDN or PSTN, or numbers that are not yet ready to be migrated to myCloudPBX.

Using the Vanity Number feature allows customers to use numbers on their traditional PBX but commence configuring the service, offices, and users all prior to migrating (porting) those numbers to myCloudPBX.

**How are they used?**

When a call is made the receiver sees the caller’s number as a number that may have been migrated yet, but already displays as though it is.

You can Add an existing phone number to your myCloudPBX service that isn't "hosted" on myCloudPBX, and use it to make calls, associate that number as the default outbound number on an office, and link that number to an extension as the outbound caller ID number when making calls.

**Benefits of Vanity Numbers?**

No waiting - Customers don’t have to wait until they have migrated their numbers to the new system, but can present their numbers as though they have already been processed, even though the migration process is still taking place.
